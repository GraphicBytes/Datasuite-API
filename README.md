# DATA SUITE API #

A data collection API that was quickly thrown together back in 2020 to serve embeddable web forms to capture form submission data, with moderation actions and 3rd party API push

This project is designed to handle various functions related to user interactions, including login checks and file uploads.

The API served the Datasuite Admin APP at: https://github.com/GraphicBytes/Datasuite-Admin-App
